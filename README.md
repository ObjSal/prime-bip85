**Bitcoin · Seeds** — one backup to rule them all: derive every wallet you'll ever hand out from the seed you already protect.

BIP-85 turns your Passport Prime's master seed into a family tree of independent secrets. Need a seed for a hot wallet, a gift, a test device, a friend getting started — or a password that can never be forgotten? Derive a child — a fresh 12-, 18-, or 24-word mnemonic, a WIF key, an XPRV, raw entropy, or a strong password — and hand it out knowing that no child can ever reveal its siblings or the parent. Lose everything, restore your one seed phrase, and every child you ever derived comes back, identical. Fully offline, like everything on Prime.

## What it derives

| Application | Output |
|---|---|
| BIP-39 · 12 / 18 / 24 words | a mnemonic for another wallet |
| WIF | a Bitcoin Core `sethdseed` key |
| XPRV | a BIP-32 root for coordinators |
| HEX · 32 / 64 bytes | raw entropy for anything else |
| Password · 20–86 chars | a base64 password (default 21 ≈ 126 bits) for anything with a login |

## Features

- **Standards-compliant by proof** — pinned to the official [BIP-85](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0085.mediawiki) test vectors, and every application cross-verified byte-for-byte against an independent BIP-85 implementation: same seed in, same child out, on all eight derivation types.
- **SeedQR out** — show any mnemonic as a SeedQR (SeedSigner standard) for direct camera import into any SeedQR-aware wallet; WIF/XPRV/HEX render as plain QRs.
- **Fingerprints for verification** — the home screen shows your master seed's BIP-32 fingerprint, and every BIP-39/XPRV child shows *its* fingerprint — so you can confirm a restored wallet imported the right child at a glance.
- **10,000 children per application** — indexes 0–9999 via ±1/±100 stepper buttons; no keyboard needed.
- **Mainnet & testnet encodings** — WIF and XPRV can be encoded for testnet (clearly banner-labeled).
- **Save derivations on your terms** — to private Internal storage by default, or to the USB-visible Airlock behind an explicit warning, with a built-in browser to view and delete saved files.
- **Bare-seed root, always** — children derive from the master seed itself; BIP-39 passphrases never enter the derivation (KeyOS exposes base entropy only), so a wallet that folds an active BIP-39 passphrase into its BIP-85 children will derive a different family. The derive screen says so, right above the button.
- **Secrets stay secret** — nothing sensitive ever appears in logs, and everything happens on a device with no network stack.

## Get it running

With the Foundation SDK installed, build and launch in the simulator with:

```bash
foundation sim
```

The simulator boots without a wallet seed — see **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)** for seed provisioning, derivation paths, correctness testing, and permissions.
